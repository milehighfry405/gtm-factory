# Developing a GTM Hypothesis

**Status:** Development paused. Ironing out the framework.

## The Thesis

What used to be "best practices" - MEDDPICC, SPIN, Challenger - becomes table stakes with AI. Every SDR will have qualification frameworks baked into their workflow. That's not differentiation anymore. That's baseline.

Differentiation moves upstream. To the strategic layer that decides *what* to qualify and *why*. To the system that captures the reasoning behind every GTM decision, learns from outcomes, and sharpens the hypothesis over time.

That's what I'm building.

## What This Is

I've spent the last four weeks pulling apart GTM methodologies, classical rhetoric, and where they intersect. What I found: the best sales frameworks are just applied rhetoric, fragmented and rebranded. Nobody has unified them.

**Three layers that stack:**

### 1. GTM Framework

The foundation synthesizes what already works: YC's frequency heuristic, SPIN's severity mapping, Sandler's three levels of pain, MEDDPICC's qualification criteria. These are inputs, not the insight.

The insight is applying **stasis theory** - a rhetorical framework for identifying what's actually being argued. Is the disagreement about fact? Definition? Severity? Action? Most sales methodologies skip this entirely. They teach reps how to qualify without teaching them what the real objection is.

This layer surfaces the delta between your hypothesis and market reality. *The pain is real but the buyer is unaware. The pain exists but it's different than you assumed. The urgency isn't there.* The framework tells you where you're wrong so you can adjust.

### 2. Rhetoric as Operating System

The core thesis: rhetoric is about getting someone to **act**. Not winning the argument - winning the argument in a way that compels action. That's the difference between education and persuasion.

The principles are 2,000 years old. Aristotle, Cicero, Quintilian. They mapped how humans are persuaded: logos, pathos, ethos. Invention, arrangement, style, memory, delivery. This is the original GTM playbook.

Now imagine executing it at scale. Data. AI. Automation. The rhetoric provides the *what* and *why*. Modern tooling provides the speed and precision.

### 3. Enablement Layer

These two layers don't magically produce repeatable motion. But they can turn sellers into something closer to hyper-enabled machines. They know what to say. They know *why* they're saying it. Every conversation feeds signal back into the system.

Inside sales executes because the framework is embedded in every touchpoint. Field sales builds relationships with precision because they know who to talk to, what to validate, and how to advance. The loop closes. The hypothesis sharpens.

## What This Drives

The metrics investors actually care about right now:

- **CAC** - down
- **LTV** - up
- **NRR** - increased
- **Pipeline velocity** - faster
- **Forecast accuracy** - real

And it's fast. Not a 12-month transformation. A system that learns and tightens with every rep, every deal, every quarter.
