## The Problem

**Revenue is unpredictable.**

Every founder knows this pain. Every investor asks about it. Every board meeting circles back to it.

The industry's response? More tools. More dashboards. More methodologies with acronyms. MEDDPICC. BANT. SPIN. Challenger.

They're not wrong. They're incomplete.

They tell you *how* to qualify. They don't tell you *where you're stuck* or *what to do about it*.

---

## The Insight

2,500 years ago, the Greeks and Romans solved this problem.

Not the revenue problem. The persuasion problem. The "how do I move someone from knowing to acting" problem.

They called it **rhetoric**. Not in the pejorative sense. In the original sense: *the art of discovering the available means of persuasion in any given case*.

Aristotle systematized it. Cicero operationalized it. Quintilian perfected it.

**What I discovered:** every modern sales methodology is just fragmented, rebranded classical rhetoric. Nobody has unified them. Until now.

---

## The Framework

Three gates. Sequential. Each one must pass before the next matters.

### Gate 1: PAIN
**Does the problem exist?**

This is objective ground truth. Like pathology - it's there whether anyone has diagnosed it yet. Either your ICP has this problem or they don't.

- **Rhetorical stasis:** Conjecture (question of fact)
- **Dominant proof:** Logos (logic and evidence)
- **If it fails:** You're in the wrong room. Pivot ICP or problem.

### Gate 2: AWARENESS
**Do they see it? Can they name it?**

The problem exists, but do they recognize it? Do they frame it the way you do? This is about alignment between your vocabulary and theirs.

- **Rhetorical stasis:** Definition (what IS this thing?)
- **Dominant proof:** Logos + Ethos (logic plus credibility to reframe)
- **If it fails:** Hidden pain. Educate with persuasive intent. Prove the disease exists.

### Gate 3: URGENCY
**Are they compelled to act NOW?**

They know the problem. They see it clearly. But is there pressure? A trigger? A deadline? Consequences for waiting?

- **Rhetorical stasis:** Quality + Procedure (severe enough? right time?)
- **Dominant proof:** Pathos (emotion - fear of loss beats aspiration)
- **If it fails:** No forcing function. Amplify severity. Make status quo untenable.

### Outcome: VIABLE MARKET

All three gates passed. All stases resolved.

You have the full rhetorical stack available:
- **Logos** to prove
- **Ethos** to trust
- **Pathos** to move

Execute.

## Why Classical Rhetoric?

Because human nature hasn't changed.

Aristotle's three proofs (Logos, Ethos, Pathos) still describe how people are persuaded. Cicero's stasis theory still identifies where arguments break down. Quintilian's insistence on moral character still explains why trust compounds.

Modern GTM methodologies rediscovered these principles and gave them new names:
- MEDDPICC's "Identified Pain" → Stasis at Conjecture
- Challenger's "Reframe" → Moving Definition stasis
- SPIN's "Implication Questions" → Pathos deployment

The classics aren't academic. They're operational. They've just been forgotten.

## What I'm Building

A system that embeds this framework into every GTM motion.

**The diagnostic layer:** Where is the market stuck? Which gate is failing? What stasis are we arguing at?

**The prescription layer:** Not just diagnosis but action. Each failure state has a specific rhetorical response grounded in 2,500 years of proven practice.

**The execution layer:** AI-powered research that feeds the diagnostic. Agents that do Inventio (discovery) and Memoria (context) perfectly. Humans who show up for Actio (delivery) with full preparation.

What scales: research, context, diagnosis, message generation.

What doesn't scale: trust. Presence. Reading the room. Kairos - knowing the right moment.

The system does everything *around* the human moment so the human can focus on what only humans can do.

---

## Why Development is Paused

Building the system surfaced a harder question: *what exactly should it be doing?*

Every AI GTM tool optimizes execution. Faster emails. Better sequences. More personalization. But execution of *what*? Based on *what* understanding of how persuasion actually works?

That question sent me back to first principles. Weeks of pulling apart sales methodologies, tracing them to their roots, asking: what's actually going on when someone moves from knowing to acting?

The answer was rhetoric. The original discipline - not the pejorative. Aristotle's proofs. Cicero's stasis theory. Quintilian's 12 books on creating the complete orator.

The framework had to come first. The system is just infrastructure. This is the foundation it runs on.

## Current State

The framework is complete. The visualization is live.

**What exists:**
- [Live interactive framework](https://finora.live) - The full diagnostic with rhetorical grounding
- 15,000+ words of research - Aristotle, Cicero, Quintilian, and power literature mapped to GTM
- Core architecture for the AI system (orchestrator, researchers, generators) - paused but ready

**What's next:**
- Signal mapping - making each gate researchable with observable indicators
- Resume system integration - with the framework as the foundation
- Field validation with real pipeline

---

## The Bet

Most AI GTM tools optimize the wrong layer. They make reps faster at doing what they were already doing.

This optimizes the strategic layer. It tells you *what* to do and *why* - grounded in principles that have worked for 2,500 years.

The insight isn't "AI can help with sales." Everyone knows that.

The insight is: **rhetoric is the operating system for persuasion, and nobody has built on it yet.**
