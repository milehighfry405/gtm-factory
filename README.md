## The Problem

**Revenue is unpredictable.**

The industry has methodologies: MEDDPICC. BANT. SPIN. Challenger. They teach qualification - how to assess whether an opportunity is real.

They don't answer the harder question: *when a deal stalls, where exactly is it stuck?*

They diagnose pass/fail. They don't prescribe what to do next.

## The Discovery

Researching this, I traced modern sales methodologies back to their roots. Every one of them fragments the same source material: classical rhetoric.

Aristotle's *Rhetoric*. Cicero's *De Inventione* and *De Oratore*. Quintilian's *Institutio Oratoria*.

These aren't academic texts. They're operational frameworks for persuasion - how to move someone from knowing to acting. The Greeks and Romans treated this as the highest discipline. They mapped it completely.

Modern GTM methodologies rediscovered pieces:
- MEDDPICC's "Identified Pain" → Aristotle's stasis at Conjecture
- Challenger's "Reframe" → Moving stasis from Conjecture to Definition
- SPIN's "Implication Questions" → Pathos deployment

Nobody unified them. The original framework got lost.

## The Framework

Three gates. Sequential. Each must pass before the next matters.

### Gate 1: PAIN
*Does the problem exist?*

Objective ground truth. Like pathology - present whether diagnosed or not.

- **Stasis:** Conjecture (question of fact)
- **Proof:** Logos (evidence)
- **If it fails:** Wrong room. Pivot ICP or problem.

### Gate 2: AWARENESS
*Do they see it? Can they name it?*

Frame alignment. Their vocabulary and yours must match.

- **Stasis:** Definition (what IS this?)
- **Proof:** Logos + Ethos (logic plus credibility to reframe)
- **If it fails:** Hidden pain. Prove the disease exists.

### Gate 3: URGENCY
*Are they compelled to act NOW?*

Pressure. Trigger. Deadline. Consequence.

- **Stasis:** Quality + Procedure (severe enough? right time?)
- **Proof:** Pathos (emotion - fear of loss beats aspiration)
- **If it fails:** No forcing function. Amplify severity.

### Outcome: VIABLE MARKET

All gates passed. All stases resolved. Full rhetorical stack available.

## The System (Paused)

Building an AI system to execute this framework surfaced a harder question: *what exactly should it be doing?*

Most AI GTM tools optimize execution speed. But execution of what? Based on what theory of how persuasion works?

That question required going back to first principles. The framework had to come first. The system is infrastructure - this is the foundation it runs on.

**What exists:**
- [Live framework](https://finora.live) - Full diagnostic with rhetorical grounding
- Research synthesis - 15,000+ words mapping classical sources to GTM
- Core architecture (orchestrator, researchers, generators) - paused

**What's next:**
- Signal mapping - making each gate observable
- System integration with the framework as foundation
- Field validation
