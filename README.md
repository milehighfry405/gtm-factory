## What This Is

The Greeks and Romans believed rhetoric was the most important discipline for humans. Not rhetoric as we use the word now — empty speech — but the systematic art of moving people to action.

The perfect orator was the most powerful person in the world. Could inspire a republic or destroy one. Aristotle, Cicero, Quintilian — they spent centuries mapping exactly how persuasion works. The proofs: logos (logic), pathos (emotion), ethos (credibility). The canons: invention, arrangement, style, memory, delivery. Stasis theory: finding where an argument is actually stuck. The psychology of audiences by age, fortune, emotional state.

They mapped it completely. 2,500 years ago.

And they insisted the true orator must be a good person — not just for ethics, but for efficacy. Quintilian's *vir bonus dicendi peritus*: the good man skilled in speaking. His argument: a bad person lacks the wisdom for true eloquence, their mind is distracted by guilt, and they can't speak on virtue with authority. The moral path IS the effective path because the foundation doesn't erode.

Modern GTM methodologies rediscovered fragments of this. MEDDPICC qualification. SPIN's implication questions. Challenger's reframe. Useful pieces — but disconnected from the unified system, and missing the prescriptive layer that tells you what to DO when something stalls.

**What I'm building:**

A diagnostic framework that tells you WHERE you're stuck — three gated variables (Pain, Awareness, Urgency) that must pass in sequence. And a rhetorical operating layer that tells you WHAT TO DO about it — stasis theory identifies what's actually being contested, the proofs tell you which lever to pull, the canons give you a workflow.

The diagnosis without prescription is useless. "Awareness is low" means nothing if you don't know the move. The rhetoric provides the move: stasis is stuck at Conjecture or Definition. Lead with logos. Prove the disease exists. Reframe how they see it.

Eventually: agents that execute this systematically. Perfect research. Perfect context. Perfect memoria — every signal, every prior interaction, every relevant case study, instantly available. The system handles inventio and memoria so humans can focus on the one thing that doesn't scale: actio. Presence. Trust. The human moment that closes the deal.

The insight that started this: AI makes qualification frameworks table stakes. Soon every SDR will have MEDDPICC baked into their workflow automatically. That's not differentiation anymore — that's baseline. Differentiation moves upstream to strategy (the hypothesis, the reasoning, the WHY behind every GTM decision) and downstream to the human relationship (the trust that can't be automated).

Field sales becomes MORE important, not less — because everything around it is optimized. The rep shows up with perfect preparation, executing a rhetorically-grounded playbook, with the one thing agents can't provide: presence.

## Current State

**What exists:**
- [The framework](https://finora.live) — interactive visualization mapping diagnosis to rhetorical prescription
- Research synthesis — 15,000+ words connecting classical sources to GTM operations
- The hypothesis — being developed, documented, validated

**What's next:**
- Signal mapping — making each gate observable with specific, researchable indicators
- Agent architecture — graduated autonomy, humans validating outputs until the framework proves itself
- Field validation — testing this against real pipeline
