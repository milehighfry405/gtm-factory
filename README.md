## The Thesis

What used to be "best practices" — MEDDPICC, SPIN, Challenger — becomes table stakes with AI. Every SDR will have qualification frameworks baked into their workflow. That's not differentiation anymore. That's baseline.

Differentiation moves upstream. To the strategic layer that decides *what* to qualify and *why*. To a system that captures the reasoning behind GTM decisions, learns from outcomes, and sharpens the hypothesis over time.

That's what I'm building toward.

## What's Here

**A diagnostic framework with a rhetorical operating layer.**

The diagnostic piece came first: three gated variables — Pain, Awareness, Urgency — that determine market viability. Sequential gates. Each must pass before the next matters. This tells you WHERE you're stuck.

The problem: diagnosis without prescription is useless. Knowing "Awareness is low" doesn't tell you what to do about it.

So I went looking for an operational layer. What I found was classical rhetoric — Aristotle, Cicero, Quintilian. Not as historical curiosity, but as a systematic framework for moving people from knowing to acting.

The mapping turned out to be useful:

- **Stasis theory** tells you what's actually being contested (fact? definition? severity? timing?)
- **The three proofs** (logos, pathos, ethos) tell you which lever to pull
- **The five canons** give you a workflow from research through delivery

When a gate fails, the rhetoric prescribes what to do. Low Awareness? Stasis is stuck at Conjecture or Definition — lead with logos, prove the disease exists, reframe how they see it. No Urgency? Stasis is stuck at Quality — lead with pathos, amplify severity, surface consequences.

The framework unifies diagnosis with prescription.

## Current State

**What exists:**
- [The framework](https://finora.live) — interactive visualization with rhetorical grounding
- Research synthesis — comprehensive mapping of classical sources to GTM concepts
- This hypothesis — being developed and validated

**What's next:**
- Signal mapping — making each gate observable and researchable
- System architecture — agents that execute against the framework
- Field validation
