# GTM RHETORIC FRAMEWORK - COMPLETE DOCUMENTATION

---

# SECTION 0: CLAUDE.md - PROJECT INSTRUCTIONS

## Project Overview

Building a GTM framework grounded in classical rhetoric that:
1. Systematically identifies the true problem (π) a product solves
2. Maps prospect state to variables (P, W, T, U, R, E)
3. Uses rhetorical principles to close the gap between our frame and their frame
4. Creates traceable logic: Signal → Variable → Adjustment

## The Core Equation

```
A = (T × F × P × W × U) / (R + E)
```

A = Likelihood of Action

## Variables (Memorize These)

| Variable | Definition |
|----------|------------|
| π₀ | Problem hypothesis |
| π | Validated problem |
| α | Our anchor/frame |
| F | Fit (product-problem match) |
| P | Pain (severity) |
| W | Awareness (0-4 scale) |
| T | Trust |
| U | Urgency |
| R | Risk (perceived) |
| E | Effort (switching cost) |

## The Four Phases

1. **Hypothesis** — Define α₀ using stasis on ourselves
2. **Market Response** — Test α₀, begin dialectic with market
3. **Customer Truth** — Observe real usage, validate π
4. **Convergence** — α is proven, pattern holds

## Rhetoric → GTM Mapping

- **Stasis** = Diagnostic (where is the gap?)
- **Dialectic** = Iteration principle (exchange with market)
- **Invention** = Discovering arguments that move variables
- **Three Proofs** = Levers (Ethos→T, Logos→W/F, Pathos→P/U/R)

## Current Status

Framework structure defined. Needs:
1. Deep research on adjacent science (Fogg, Cialdini, JTBD)
2. Signal mapping (what behaviors indicate what variables)
3. Feedback loop architecture
4. Human-readable presentation layer

## Working Style

- User wants BEST IN CLASS for everything
- Cost is not a concern — optimize for quality
- Complex problems need research agents that go deep
- Output must be traceable and digestible
- Build incrementally: research → synthesize → commit → iterate

## Research Agent Architecture (To Build)

HQ (this session) = synthesis + decisions + commits
Research Agents = go deep, burn tokens, return distilled output
Shared Memory = filesystem, persists conclusions
Presentation = UI/frontend for human consumption

## Important Context

The user is a GTM Automation Manager building AI-powered GTM systems. They think in systems, want mathematical precision, and are frustrated by scattered knowledge across hundreds of LLM chats. This framework is meant to unify everything.

The framework is NOVEL in combining classical rhetoric with GTM metrics. Don't assume existing solutions exist — we're building something new while drawing from established principles.

## Next Immediate Steps

1. Confirm understanding of full context from session dump
2. Propose research agent architecture
3. Identify first research task
4. Build the infrastructure to persist findings

# SECTION 1: FRAMEWORK OVERVIEW

## The Core Idea

Two frames. One gap. Close it.

- **Your Frame (α):** The problem you solve and why it matters
- **Their Frame:** How they currently see their world
- **The Gap:** Distance between these two
- **The Work:** Use rhetoric to close the gap so they take action

---

## Variables (Reference)

### Core Variables

| Variable | Definition |
|----------|------------|
| π₀ | Problem hypothesis — what we believe we solve |
| π | Validated problem — what we actually solve |
| α | Our anchor/frame — π + pain claim + solution |
| P | Pain — severity of problem |
| W | Awareness — do they see the problem the way we define it |
| F | Fit — how well our product solves the problem (0-10) |
| T | Trust — will they listen to us |
| U | Urgency — timing pressure, forcing functions |
| R | Risk — perceived cost of change |
| E | Effort — switching/implementation cost |

### Derived Variables

| Variable | Derivation |
|----------|------------|
| I (Intent) | I = P × W |
| G (Engagement) | G ≈ I (observable signal of intent) |

### The Action Equation

```
A = (T × F × P × W × U) / (R + E)
```

A = Likelihood of Action

---

## Phase 1: Hypothesis (Pre-Market)

### Purpose
Define α₀ (initial anchor) before going to market.

### Rhetoric Tools

**Stasis on Yourself:**

| Stasis | Internal Question |
|--------|-------------------|
| Conjecture | Do we believe this problem is real? What's our evidence? |
| Definition | What exactly IS the problem? How do we name it? |
| Quality | How painful do we claim it is? What's the cost? |
| Policy | Why is our solution the right answer? |

**Topoi to Pressure-Test:**

| Topos | Question |
|-------|----------|
| Cause/Effect | What causes this pain? What happens if ignored? |
| Comparison | How does this compare to adjacent problems? |
| Consequence | What's the cost of inaction? |

### Output

Documented claim:

> "We believe [specific people] have [specific problem] and it costs them [specific pain]. They currently think about it as [their frame]."

### Variables Produced

| Variable | Source |
|----------|--------|
| π₀ | Stasis: Definition |
| P₀ | Stasis: Quality + Topos: Consequence |
| W₀ | Stasis: Conjecture + Definition (how do we think THEY see it?) |

### Confidence Level
**Low** — untested hypothesis

---

## Phase 2: Market Response (GTM Live)

### Purpose
Test α₀ against market. Begin dialectic.

### Rhetoric Tools

**Stasis on the Market:**

| Stasis | Market Question |
|--------|-----------------|
| Conjecture | Do people express this pain? Where? How? |
| Definition | What do THEY call it? What do they think causes it? |
| Quality | How bad do THEY say it is? |
| Policy | What are THEY currently doing about it? |

**Three Proofs (to move variables):**

| Proof | Variables Affected | How |
|-------|-------------------|-----|
| Ethos | T | Credibility, authority, shared identity |
| Logos | W, F | Evidence, logic, demonstration |
| Pathos | P, U, R | Emotion, fear, desire, urgency |

**Three Objectives:**

| Objective | What It Does | Variables Moved |
|-----------|--------------|-----------------|
| Docere (teach) | Shifts awareness | W |
| Delectare (delight) | Builds trust | T |
| Movere (move) | Drives action | P, U, lowers R |

### Inputs
- Marketing deployed based on α₀
- Sales conversations
- Prospect responses

### Signals to Track
- Engagement rates
- Response patterns
- Objections raised
- Drop-off points
- Conversion rates

### Diagnostic Logic

**If:** High F + High W + High P → No Conversion

**Then:** α is wrong. Not them.

**If:** Some convert, some don't (same profile)

**Then:** Segment deeper. Missing variable.

### Output
- Gap analysis: α vs. their frame
- Iteration: α₀ → α₁ → α₂

### Confidence Level
**Medium** — leading indicators, still noisy

---

## Phase 3: Customer Truth (Signed Deals + Usage)

### Purpose
Observe real behavior. Validate π itself.

### Key Questions
- How do they actually use it?
- What do they use it for?
- Did we solve the problem we thought?
- What language do they use to describe the value?

### Inputs
- X signed customers
- Usage data
- Customer conversations
- Support tickets
- Expansion/churn patterns

### Diagnostic Logic

**If:** Usage matches π₀

**Then:** α validated

**If:** Usage diverges from π₀

**Then:** π₀ was wrong. They're solving a different problem.

### Output
- Validated π (or major pivot)
- Refined α based on ground truth

### Confidence Level
**High** — real behavior, not stated preference

---

## Phase 4: Convergence (Dialed Anchor)

### Purpose
α is proven. Pattern holds.

### Characteristics
- Deals close predictably
- Non-conversion = prospect issue (wrong segment, timing, blockers)
- NOT anchor issue
- Deviations signal market shifts, not framework flaws

### Ongoing Work
- Monitor for pattern breaks
- Detect market shifts early
- Expand to adjacent segments using same framework

### Confidence Level
**Very High** — proven, repeatable

---

## The Rhetoric → GTM Mapping

### Principles

| Rhetoric Principle | GTM Function |
|-------------------|--------------|
| Stasis | Diagnostic — where is the gap? |
| Dialectic | Iteration — exchange with market to refine α |
| Invention | Discovering arguments that move variables |
| Topoi | Prompts for finding new angles each iteration |
| Three Proofs | Levers that move P, W, T, U, R |
| Three Objectives | Stages: teach → delight → move |

### Canons as Workflow

| Canon | GTM Application |
|-------|-----------------|
| Invention | Discover what arguments move each variable per segment |
| Arrangement | Sequence messaging across funnel stages |
| Style | Match tone/channel to awareness level |
| Memory | Own positioning so deeply you adapt in real-time |
| Delivery | Execution — channels, timing, format |

---

## Signal → Variable → Adjustment Logic

*(To be built out as framework is applied)*

```
Signal observed: [X]
    ↓
Maps to variable: [Y]
    ↓
Indicates gap in: [Z]
    ↓
Logic stored: [Why we believe this]
    ↓
Adjustment: [Messaging / Product / Targeting]
```

---

## Assumptions

**F → 100%**

This framework assumes we are working toward perfect fit. The goal is to find π such that our product solves it completely.

If F is low, that's a product problem, not a GTM problem.

---

## Open Questions

- How do we measure W precisely?
- What signals indicate each stasis level?
- How do we codify the logic for tracing back failures?
- What's the threshold for "enough" customers in Phase 3?

---

# SECTION 2: THE CLASSICAL RHETORIC FOUNDATION

## Why Rhetoric?

The user's insight: Classical rhetoric is a 2000+ year old framework for persuading people into action. This maps directly to GTM — both are about moving someone from their current state to taking action (buying).

The goal: Extract the systematic approach from rhetoric and operationalize it as GTM framework.

---

## The Key Classical Sources

### Primary Texts

| Text | Author | Date | Key Contribution |
|------|--------|------|------------------|
| Rhetoric | Aristotle | 4th c BCE | Three proofs (ethos, logos, pathos), topoi, foundational theory |
| Rhetorica ad Herennium | Anonymous | c. 86-82 BCE | First complete five canons, memory techniques, practical Roman handbook |
| De Inventione | Cicero | c. 84 BCE | Five canons, stasis, early systematic treatment |
| De Oratore | Cicero | 55 BCE | Ideal orator, broad education, philosophy + rhetoric |
| Institutio Oratoria | Quintilian | 95 CE | Twelve volumes, comprehensive, culmination of Greco-Roman theory |
| On Issues (Peri Staseon) | Hermogenes | 2nd c CE | Canonical stasis system (13 stases) |

### Critical Note on Sources

**The "unified classical system" is a modern reconstruction.**

- The five canons are ROMAN codification, not Greek
- Aristotle doesn't organize his Rhetoric this way
- Different authors define stasis differently (3, 4, or 13 stases depending on source)
- Quintilian explicitly pushes back on rigid structure

This matters because: We should use rhetoric as inspiration, not dogma. The synthesis is operationally useful even if historically imprecise.

---

## The Five Canons

The stages of preparing a speech/argument:

### 1. Invention (Inventio)
**Finding what to say.**

This is where 80% of the work happens. Includes:
- Stasis analysis (identifying the real issue)
- Three proofs (ethos, logos, pathos)
- Topoi (places to find arguments)

### 2. Arrangement (Dispositio)
**Ordering for maximum impact.**

Classical structure:
- Exordium (introduction)
- Narratio (statement of facts)
- Partitio (division/preview)
- Confirmatio (proof)
- Refutatio (refutation)
- Peroratio (conclusion)

### 3. Style (Elocutio)
**How to say it.**

Three levels:
- Plain (teach, prove)
- Middle (delight, maintain interest)
- Grand (move, inspire action)

### 4. Memory (Memoria)
**Owning your material.**

Method of loci (memory palace). Purpose: Adapt in real-time, project confidence.

### 5. Delivery (Pronuntiatio)
**Physical execution.**

Voice (volume, pitch, pace, pause) + Body (posture, gesture, eye contact).

---

## Stasis Theory

**The diagnostic tool for finding where an argument actually lives.**

Before you argue, identify WHAT'S BEING DISPUTED:

| Stasis | Question | If stuck here... |
|--------|----------|------------------|
| Conjecture | Does it exist? Did it happen? | They don't believe the problem is real |
| Definition | What is it? What do we call it? | They see a different problem than you |
| Quality | Is it good/bad? Is it enough? | They don't think it's painful enough |
| Policy | What should be done? | They're comparing solutions |

**Critical insight:** Stasis is a DIAGNOSTIC you run with the audience, not by yourself. This is why it maps to market research.

**Stasis lives INSIDE Invention.** It's a technique within the first canon, not a parallel system.

---

## The Three Proofs (Pisteis)

Your three weapons for persuasion:

### Ethos (Character/Credibility)
Why should they trust YOU?
- Demonstrate competence
- Show goodwill toward audience
- Establish shared identity
- Attack opponent's credibility

### Logos (Logic/Evidence)
The rational case.
- Enthymemes (rhetorical syllogisms)
- Examples and analogies
- Signs and probabilities
- Data, testimony, documents

### Pathos (Emotion)
The feeling that drives action.
- Fear, anger, pity, indignation
- Making them FEEL the stakes
- This converts agreement → action

**Key:** Most people only use logos. Masters stack all three.

---

## The Three Objectives

What you're trying to do to the audience:

| Objective | What It Does | Variable Affected |
|-----------|--------------|-------------------|
| Docere (teach) | Convince the mind | Awareness |
| Delectare (delight) | Win goodwill, keep engaged | Trust |
| Movere (move) | Stir emotion, compel action | Pain, Urgency, Risk |

---

## Topoi (Topics)

Prompts for generating arguments. A checklist for invention.

**Common Topoi:**
- Possible/Impossible
- Past fact / Future fact
- More/Less (degree)
- Cause/Effect
- Comparison (similarity, difference)
- Definition
- Contradiction
- Consequences

**Specific Topoi (by genre):**
- Deliberative (policy): What's advantageous? Safe? Just?
- Forensic (legal): What's lawful? Fair? Precedented?
- Epideictic (praise/blame): What's noble? Virtuous?

---

## Dialectic

**The principle that governs iteration.**

- Rhetoric = persuading an audience
- Dialectic = finding truth through exchange

When you talk to prospects, run A/B tests, analyze conversions — you're in dialectic with the market. The market responds. You refine. Repeat.

Stasis tells you WHAT to fix.
Dialectic is WHY you keep iterating.
Invention is the work of each iteration.

---

# SECTION 3: THE GTM APPLICATION

## Core Idea

**Two frames. One gap. Close it.**

- **Your Frame (α):** The problem you solve and why it matters
- **Their Frame:** How they currently see their world
- **The Gap:** Distance between these two
- **The Work:** Use rhetoric to close the gap so they take action

---

## The Foundational Assumption

**F → 100%**

The framework assumes we're working toward perfect fit. The product perfectly solves a specific problem.

If F is low, that's a product problem, not a GTM problem.

The goal is finding π (the problem) such that our product solves it completely.

---

## The Problem Hypothesis

### π₀ = Initial Hypothesis

This comes from somewhere:
- Founder felt pain themselves
- Observed pain in market
- Intuition
- Existing product looking for better positioning

You don't start from nothing. You start with a guess.

### π = Validated Problem

What you land on after testing. May equal π₀. Often doesn't.

### The Flow

```
π₀ (hypothesis)
    ↓
Stasis on market (test)
    ↓
π (validated problem)
    ↓
F = how well product solves π
```

**Most products skip this. They assume π₀ = π and wonder why messaging doesn't land.**

---

## The Variables

### Core Variables

| Variable | Definition |
|----------|------------|
| π₀ | Problem hypothesis — what we believe we solve |
| π | Validated problem — what we actually solve |
| α | Our anchor/frame — π + pain claim + solution |
| F | Fit — how well our product solves the problem (0-10) |
| P | Pain — severity of problem |
| W | Awareness — do they see the problem the way we define it (0-4 scale) |
| T | Trust — will they listen to us |
| U | Urgency — timing pressure, forcing functions |
| R | Risk — perceived cost of change |
| E | Effort — switching/implementation cost |

### Derived Variables

| Variable | Derivation |
|----------|------------|
| I (Intent) | I = P × W |
| G (Engagement) | G ≈ I (observable signal) |

### The Awareness Scale (W)

From Eugene Schwartz:

0. Unaware — Don't know they have a problem
1. Problem Aware — Feel pain, can't name it
2. Solution Aware — Know solutions exist, don't know your product
3. Product Aware — Know your product, not convinced
4. Most Aware — Ready to buy

---

## The Action Equation

```
A = (T × F × P × W × U) / (R + E)
```

**A = Likelihood of Action**

- Numerator: Drivers (push toward action)
- Denominator: Blockers (prevent action)

### How to Increase A

- Find higher P (better market/segment)
- Increase W (shift awareness toward your frame)
- Build T (credibility, trust)
- Create U (urgency, forcing functions)
- Lower R (reduce perceived risk)
- Lower E (make it easier)

---

## The Anchor (α)

α = Your frame. It has three components:

| Component | What It Is |
|-----------|------------|
| Problem Definition | The specific pain we claim exists |
| Fit Claim | How well we solve it |
| Trust Basis | Why anyone should believe us |

### Our Frame vs. Their Frame

**Our Frame (α):**
- Problem as we define it
- Pain we claim
- Solution we offer

**Their Frame (for any prospect):**
- P = Do they have the problem we defined? How bad?
- W = Do they see it the way we define it?
- T = Do they believe us?

### The Gap

**Gap = α − Their Frame**

- If P is low → wrong prospect OR we defined wrong problem
- If W is low → they have it but see it differently (reframe needed)
- If T is low → they see it but don't trust us (credibility needed)

---

## The Rhetorical → GTM Mapping

### Stasis as Diagnostic

| Stasis | GTM Question |
|--------|--------------|
| Conjecture | Do people express this pain? Where? How? |
| Definition | What do THEY call it? What do they think causes it? |
| Quality | How bad do THEY say it is? |
| Policy | What are THEY currently doing about it? |

### Three Proofs as Levers

| Proof | Variables Affected | How |
|-------|-------------------|-----|
| Ethos | T | Credibility, authority, shared identity |
| Logos | W, F | Evidence, logic, demonstration |
| Pathos | P, U, R | Emotion, fear, desire, urgency |

### Three Objectives as Stages

| Objective | What It Does | Variables Moved |
|-----------|--------------|-----------------|
| Docere | Shifts awareness | W |
| Delectare | Builds trust | T |
| Movere | Drives action | P, U, lowers R |

### Canons as Workflow

| Canon | GTM Application |
|-------|-----------------|
| Invention | Discover what arguments move each variable per segment |
| Arrangement | Sequence messaging across funnel stages |
| Style | Match tone/channel to awareness level |
| Memory | Own positioning so deeply you adapt in real-time |
| Delivery | Execution — channels, timing, format |

```

---

## Phase 1: Hypothesis (Pre-Market)

**No dialectic. Pure invention.**

### Purpose
Define α₀ (initial anchor) before going to market.

### Rhetoric Tools Used
- **Stasis on yourself** — Force clarity on what you're claiming
- **Topoi** — Prompts to articulate hypothesis fully
- **Invention** — Discovering your own argument before presenting it

### Stasis Questions (Internal)

| Stasis | Question |
|--------|----------|
| Conjecture | Do we believe this problem is real? What's our evidence? |
| Definition | What exactly IS the problem? How do we name it? |
| Quality | How painful do we claim it is? What's the cost? |
| Policy | Why is our solution the right answer? |

### Topoi Questions (Pressure Test)

| Topos | Question |
|-------|----------|
| Cause/Effect | What causes this pain? What happens if ignored? |
| Comparison | How does this compare to adjacent problems? |
| Consequence | What's the cost of inaction? |

### Output

Documented claim:

> "We believe [specific people] have [specific problem] and it costs them [specific pain]. They currently think about it as [their frame]."

Variables produced:
- π₀ from Stasis: Definition
- P₀ from Stasis: Quality + Topos: Consequence
- W₀ from Stasis: Conjecture + Definition

### Confidence Level
**Low** — untested hypothesis

---

## Phase 2: Market Response (GTM Live)

**Dialectic begins. Exchange with market through signals.**

### Purpose
Test α₀ against market. Begin iterating.

### Rhetoric Tools Used
- **Stasis on market** — Where are THEY in the argument?
- **Three proofs** — Levers to move variables
- **Three objectives** — Stages of variable manipulation

### Stasis Questions (Market)

| Stasis | Question |
|--------|----------|
| Conjecture | Do people express this pain? Where? How? |
| Definition | What do THEY call it? What do they think causes it? |
| Quality | How bad do THEY say it is? |
| Policy | What are THEY currently doing about it? |

### Inputs
- Marketing deployed based on α₀
- Sales conversations
- Prospect responses, objections, drop-offs

### Signals to Track
- Engagement rates
- Response patterns
- Objections raised
- Drop-off points
- Conversion rates

### Diagnostic Logic

**If:** High F + High W + High P → No Conversion
**Then:** α is wrong. Not them.

**If:** Some convert, some don't (same profile)
**Then:** Segment deeper. Missing variable.

### Output
- Gap analysis: α vs. their frame
- Iteration: α₀ → α₁ → α₂

### Confidence Level
**Medium** — leading indicators, still noisy

---

## Phase 3: Customer Truth (Signed Deals + Usage)

**Dialectic deepens. Real behavior observed.**

### Purpose
Observe real behavior. Validate π itself.

### Key Questions
- How do they actually use it?
- What do they use it for?
- Did we solve the problem we thought?
- What language do they use to describe value?

### Inputs
- X signed customers
- Usage data
- Customer conversations
- Support tickets
- Expansion/churn patterns

### Diagnostic Logic

**If:** Usage matches π₀
**Then:** α validated

**If:** Usage diverges from π₀
**Then:** π₀ was wrong. They're solving a different problem.

### Output
- Validated π (or major pivot)
- Refined α based on ground truth

### Confidence Level
**High** — real behavior, not stated preference

---

## Phase 4: Convergence (Dialed Anchor)

**Dialectic stabilizes. α is proven.**

### Characteristics
- Deals close predictably
- Non-conversion = prospect issue (wrong segment, timing, blockers)
- NOT anchor issue
- Deviations signal market shifts, not framework flaws

### Ongoing Work
- Monitor for pattern breaks
- Detect market shifts early
- Expand to adjacent segments

### Confidence Level
**Very High** — proven, repeatable

---

## The Iteration Loop

**α is a hypothesis, not truth.**

```
α₀ (initial anchor)
    ↓
Test against market
    ↓
Outcomes don't match expectations?
    ↓
Diagnose: Is it US or THEM?
    ↓
Update α OR update tactics
    ↓
α₁ (refined anchor)
    ↓
Repeat
```

### Key Insight

Initially, you'll update α more often (your hypothesis is wrong).

As you converge, deviations mean prospect issues or market shifts.

**Signed deals = ground truth. Everything before = signal with noise.**

---

# SECTION 5: THE SYSTEM ARCHITECTURE

## What's Being Built

A system where:

```
π₀ (hypothesis)
    ↓
Variables (P, W, F, T, U, R, E)
    ↓
Mapped to Signals (observable behaviors, responses)
    ↓
Logic stored (why we chose these signals, what they indicate)
    ↓
Data comes back (market response, conversations, conversions)
    ↓
Trace back to variable (what's off?)
    ↓
Adjust with precision (messaging OR product OR targeting)
```

## The Magic

When something doesn't convert, you don't guess.

You trace:
- Signal said X
- That maps to variable Y
- Y indicates gap in Z
- Adjust Z

## What This Requires

1. **Explicit π** — documented problem hypothesis
2. **Defined variables** — P, W, F, T, U, R, E with clear definitions
3. **Signal mapping** — what observable behavior indicates what variable state
4. **Stored logic** — WHY we believe signal X means variable Y
5. **Feedback loop** — data updates the model

## Signal → Variable → Adjustment Logic

*(To be built out)*

# SECTION 6: RELATED SCIENCE TO EXPLORE

## Adjacent Frameworks Mentioned

| Domain | Framework | Key Concept | Relevance |
|--------|-----------|-------------|-----------|
| Behavior Design | BJ Fogg (Stanford) | B = MAP (Motivation × Ability × Prompt) | Simplifies action equation |
| Persuasion | Cialdini | 6 Principles | Maps to Trust, social proof |
| Decision Making | Kahneman | System 1/2, Loss Aversion | Why pathos works, why R is heavy |
| Innovation | Christensen | Jobs to Be Done (JTBD) | Another lens on π |

## Fogg Behavior Model Mapping

```
B = MAP
Behavior = Motivation × Ability × Prompt
```

Maps to our framework:
- Motivation ≈ P × W (pain + awareness)
- Ability ≈ 1/(R + E) (inverse of blockers)
- Prompt ≈ U (urgency/trigger)

## Research Directions

These need deep research to integrate:

1. **BJ Fogg's Persuasive Technology Lab** — Behavior design, habit formation
2. **Cialdini's Principles** — Reciprocity, commitment, social proof, authority, liking, scarcity
3. **Kahneman's System 1/2** — How decisions actually get made
4. **JTBD** — Alternative framing of problem/solution fit
5. **Loss Aversion** — Why risk (R) weighs heavier than gain

# SECTION 7: OPEN QUESTIONS

## Framework Questions

1. How do we measure W precisely? What signals indicate each awareness level?
2. How do we codify the logic for tracing back conversion failures?
3. What's the threshold for "enough" customers in Phase 3?
4. How does competitive positioning affect F vs. R?
5. Is Trust (T) a threshold/gate or a multiplier?

## Architecture Questions

1. What signals map to which variables?
2. How do we store the logic so it's traceable?
3. What's the feedback loop infrastructure?
4. How do we present this to humans in digestible form?

## Research Questions

1. What does Fogg's model add that rhetoric doesn't cover?
2. How do Cialdini's principles map to our variables?
3. What does JTBD offer for defining π?
4. How does loss aversion affect the R variable specifically?

# SECTION 9: KEY INSIGHTS TO PRESERVE

## The Core Insight

**Stasis analysis is prospect qualification.** If you're arguing at the wrong stasis level, you lose. If you're marketing at the wrong awareness level, you waste money.

## The Frame Problem

**Product team's frame:** "We built X to solve Y"

**Prospect's frame:** Could be any of:
- "I have problem Z" (adjacent to Y)
- "I don't have a problem" (unaware)
- "I have Y but call it W"
- "I tried solving Y before and it failed"
- "Y isn't my priority"

**The rhetorical job:** Find their actual premises and construct an argument FROM there to your conclusion.

## Why This Matters

Most products assume π₀ = π and skip validation.

This framework codifies the decisions so you can:
- Trace back failures to specific variables
- Adjust with precision (not guessing)
- Build institutional knowledge
- Converge on truth faster

## The Ultimate Output

A living system that learns. Not "that campaign didn't work." Instead: "W is lower than expected in segment X, they're defining the problem differently, here's the evidence, here's the adjustment."
