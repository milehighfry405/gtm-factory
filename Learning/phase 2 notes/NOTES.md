**Context**: Exploring how classical rhetoric applies to the GTM framework (Pain → Awareness → Urgency)

**Topic**: Architecture alignment

This makes complete sense. Let me reflect back what I'm hearing to make sure we're aligned:
The architecture:

Yesterday's work = the diagnostic frame (Pain → Awareness → Urgency tells you IF the market is viable and WHERE it fails)
Today's work = the persuasive engine (rhetoric tells you HOW to move people given that diagnosis)

So if someone has Hidden Pain (high Pain, low Awareness), stasis theory tells you the argument is stuck at conjecture or definition — they don't even know the disease exists or what to call it. The rhetorical approach is fundamentally different than someone with No Urgency (high Pain, high Awareness, low Urgency) where the stasis is at quality or procedure — they know the problem, they just don't think it's severe enough to act NOW.
The sources:

Greeks (Aristotle primarily) = the philosophical WHY of persuasion, the proofs, the psychology
Romans (Cicero, Quintilian) = the operational HOW, the canons, the systematic application to achieve civilizational outcomes (law, governance, action)
Power literature (Machiavelli, etc.) = the psychological MECHANICS of human nature — not to employ the dark shit, but to understand the machinery so we can use it ethically

The output:
Systematic rhetoric at scale. Not artisanal persuasion that depends on a gifted orator — a codified system that can be executed by AI/automation with the same structural integrity that made classical rhetoric powerful.
One clarifying question before I research:
What's the execution layer look like? Is this framework ultimately driving:

Messaging/copy (what words to use)
Sequencing (what order to present arguments)
Channel selection (where to reach them based on awareness stage)
Rep enablement (what the human says in discovery/demo)
All of the above?

This affects which parts of the canons matter most. If it's messaging at scale, inventio and elocutio dominate. If it includes human delivery, memoria and actio come back into play.

## Response 2

Yes, this makes complete sense. The vision is clear:
The system:

Rhetoric framework = the "operating system" that both humans and agents run on
Same underlying logic whether it's an agent generating an ad or a field rep getting a pre-call briefing
The framework is the source of truth; the executor (human or machine) is interchangeable for most tasks

The trust insight:
You've identified the one variable that doesn't scale with AI: trust requires human presence. So you lean INTO field sales (counter to the "automate everything" trend) because you've already optimized everything else. Your field reps aren't doing discovery — the system already did that. They're there to be the human face that closes the trust gap. But they're armed with rhetoric-optimized briefings that make them devastating in-person.
The path:
Graduated autonomy. Humans validate agent outputs until the framework proves itself. Then you widen the aperture.

Alright, I have what I need. Let me go deep on:

Aristotle's Rhetoric — the proofs (logos, pathos, ethos), the psychology of persuasion, topoi
Cicero — De Oratore, De Inventione, the five canons, stasis theory origins
Quintilian — Institutio Oratoria, the unified system, the moral orator
The connective tissue — how these build on each other and where they diverge

I'll synthesize this into something we can map to your framework. Give me a bit to do the research properly — I want to pull primary source structure, not just summaries.
Should I output my research as I go (so you can course-correct), or come back with a complete synthesis?
